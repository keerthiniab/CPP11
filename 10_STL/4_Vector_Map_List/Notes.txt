Vector in C++ STL
=================
Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. 
Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. 
In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending the array. 
Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.

Iterators

List in C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
===========================================
Lists are sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation. 
As compared to vector, list has slow traversal, but once a position has been found, insertion and deletion are quick. Normally, when we say a List, we talk about doubly linked list. 
For implementing a singly linked list, we use forward list.
